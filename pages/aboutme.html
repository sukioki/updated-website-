            <h2>Welcome to Sukioki<br> by Kübra</h2>

            <p>Hewo!<br> 
                I'm Kübra, a little self-taught artist with passion and love towards art and anime.<br>
                Original from French; I have been drawing since I was a kid.<br>
                But it was several months ago when I decided to turn my hobby into a full time job by showing and selling
                my art towards this site that I made all by myself !!!<br>
                This site is meant to offer my different art as a decal so you can take it with you wherever you go and share
                the love.
                <br><br>
                It took a while to find out the right material and quality for my products, but<br>it was possible!<br>
                Now i can proudly say that my stickers are finally available!!!</p>
